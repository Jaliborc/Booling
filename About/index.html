			<h1>What is the difference between the normal and downloadable versions?</h1>
			<p>
				What if there is no internet connection when you want the students to install Booling?
				What if you want to share it by email or in a flash pen?
				Do not worry: Booling does not miss an opportunity to mess with students.
				Therefore, it is also available in a downloadable version.
