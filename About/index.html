			<h1>Normal vs Downloadable Versions</h1>
			<p>
				Whenever possible, users should work with the regular version. The downloadable version was created solely for users to share it. Using the normal one provides the following benefits: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Automatic updates</li>
				<li>A grand logo</li>
				<li>No file necessary</li>
			</ul>
