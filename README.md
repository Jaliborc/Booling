# Booling
Booling is a tool for visually teaching boolean logic. It generates truth tables to be filled by the student from boolean expressions. It was created out of pure frustration from the existing tools at the time.
It is currently used at the [University of Coimbra](http://www.uc.pt/en) as the [primary tool](http://boole.dei.uc.pt/) of the boolean logic courses.
