			<h1>Runs on any Platform</h1>
			<p>
				As Booling was designed to run in the browser, it works on any operative system.
				You will never have to worry about which platforms your students are using:
				Booling simply harasses everyone.

			<h1>Works even Offline</h1>
			<p>
				Although Booling is a web application, it works seamlessly without any kind of web connection. 
				As soon as you open the app for the first time, Booling will be installed on your browser and 
				always available for later use.

			<h1>Made for Sharing</h1>
			<p>
				What if there is no internet connection when you want the students to install Booling?
				What if you want to share it by email or in a flash pen?
				Don't worry, Booling does not miss an opportunity to mess with students.
				Therefore, it is also available in a reduced but downloadable version.

			<h1>Guaranteed Humiliation</h1>
			<p>
				Tired of holding your nerves when a student can't solve even the simplest equation?
				Consider Booling your personal bully! It will empty pockets, steal lunches and charge at students
				like a juggernaut whenever they miss, leaving no room for failure. They will even beg for their soul...
